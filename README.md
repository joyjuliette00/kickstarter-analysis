# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to provide two different analyses: one that helps to visualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch dat and one that helps visualize successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. The [Kickstarter file] (resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) has the original data set and corresponding charts for the analyses. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To be able to analyze the outcomes based on launch date, it was first necesary to extract the year as a data point from "Date Created-Conversion." A pivot table was the best tool for this analysis, and then appropriate filtering was added to look specifically at "successful," "failed," and "canceled."

The [line chart](resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) provides a visualization of the relationship between the various outcomes and each specific launch month. The best and most ideal month during the year to have a successful theater is May, and the least ideal would be December. In general, theaters are more successful during the summer, and the number of successful theaters decreases and the outcome of failing increases during the fall months. The number of canceled theaters remained constant and did not have any spikes from month to month. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
