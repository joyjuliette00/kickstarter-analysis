# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to provide two different analyses for Louise since her play, Fever, came close to the fundraising goals in a short amount of time. The first analysis helps to visualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date, and the second helps visualize successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. The [Kickstarter file] (Kickstarter_Challenge.zip) has the original data set and corresponding charts for the analyses. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To be able to analyze the outcomes based on launch date, it was first necesary to extract the year as a data point from "Date Created-Conversion." A pivot table was the best tool for this analysis, and then appropriate filtering was added to look specifically at "successful," "failed," and "canceled" in descending order so "successful" was first. There is also a filter for the pivot table based on "Parent Category" and "Years."

The [line chart](resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) was created to provide a visual representation of the three types of outcomes based on the launch date by month. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The second analysis is to look at the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. This analysis required a new spreadsheet with a 12 ranges of goal levels. The number of successful, failed, and canceled plays were counted and summed allowing for percentages of each outcome to also be run. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The [line chart](resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png) provides a visualization of the relationship between the various outcomes and each specific launch month. The best and most ideal month during the year to have a successful theater is May, and the least ideal would be December. In general, theaters are more successful during the summer, and the number of successful theaters decreases and the outcome of failing increases during the fall months. The number of canceled theaters remained constant and did not have any spikes from month to month. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
